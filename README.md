# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my data science projects repository!  
This repo serves as a central hub for future end-to-end data science projects that will demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, modeling, and evaluation.

🚧 **Note:** This repository is currently under development. Projects will be added as they are completed.

## 🧠 What to Expect

Each project will be stored in its own subfolder and include:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Predictive modeling and evaluation
- Visualizations and reporting
- Documentation and next steps

## 📁 Current Folders

- [`shift-tip-calculator/`](shift-tip-calculator/)
- [`planner/`](planner/)

## 📦 Planned Structure per Project

project-name/
├── data/         # Raw or processed datasets
├── notebooks/    # Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, or analysis
├── src/          # Python scripts (functions, classes, or pipeline code)
├── results/      # Output plots, model scores, reports
└── README.md     # Description of the project, goals, findings
